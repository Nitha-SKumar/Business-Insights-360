### Company Overview:

AtliQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years, expanding its operations globally. Specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories, the company operates through three main channels:

- Retailers
- Direct sales

However, AtliQ Hardware recently faced unexpected losses, notably with the opening of a store in America. Despite relying on surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis, the company found itself at a disadvantage compared to competitors equipped with dedicated analytics teams. Recognizing the need for data-driven insights and decisions, AtliQ Hardware is now taking steps to establish its own analytics team to enhance its competitive position in the industry.
